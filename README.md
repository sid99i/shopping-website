The WEB Application was made using React. Initialize new React App. First I set up React Bootstrap. Then I work on the Header Component. Header component includes a search box and a drop down button for shopping cart. Then i worked on product tab in which a random product id, product image , price... is taken from faker.js and a array of random product is taken. Then i worked on the filter which filters out the products based on price reviews and other things. There is also a order summary tab which tells the total of order.
